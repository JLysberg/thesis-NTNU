\subsection{Unexplored Model Architectures}

\textit{Multi-channel convolution followed by regular convolution. Would allow for individual channel features to be created before merging features in a normal convolutional manner.}

% Larger dataset and exploration of inter-task and inter-subject generalization. This is the holy grail of cognitive load classification. As sharma and .. concluded with in their papers, a classification model trained only on one subject and one task is utterly useless by itself. 



\textit{Duration of offset/idle periods. Both should have been longer in retrospect.}
