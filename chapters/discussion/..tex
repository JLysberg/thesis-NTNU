\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Dataset Weaknesses}

\textit{Duration of offset/idle periods. Both should have been longer in retrospect.}

\section{Model Classification Accuracies}

\textit{Performance of ResNet in this approach compared to others may be due to limitations in dataset, as deeper models require much more data in order to generalize well [Fawaz].}



\section{Further work}
\subsection{Unexplored Model Architectures}
\textit{Multi-channel convolution followed by regular convolution. Would allow for individual channel features to be created before merging features in a normal convolutional manner.}
