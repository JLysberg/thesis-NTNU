\section{Collaboration}

This project is a research collaboration with Osirion AS. Osirion is a newly founded team with a passion for gaming and data-driven performance analytics. We want to leverage eye-tracking and other physiological measures to facilitate sustainable and healthy gaming routines for average and professional consumers. Users should be able to effortlessly improve their skills while monitoring their eye health, sleep, mental fatigue, and more. The work presented will contribute to developing a platform where all of this is possible.
